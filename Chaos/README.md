# Chaos
#### Visualizations connecting chaos theory, fractals, and  the logistic map!
###### Written by [Jonny Hyman](https://www.jonnyhyman.com), 2020

This code was developed for [this YouTube video from Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk)

This is not a library, but rather a collection of standalone scripts! As such, there is a bit of code duplication between scripts.

# Quick start guide

#### Install these requirements
- [Python 3.6+](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (tested on Python 3.6 and Python 3.7, macOS Catalina and Windows 10)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org) package : `pip install numpy`
- [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org) package : `pip install numba`

#### Run guide for total beginners
0. Open "Terminal" on macOS & Linux, "Powershell" or "Command Prompt" on Windows
1. Download this repository and unzip it or run `git clone https://github.com/jonnyhyman/Chaos.git`
2. Change directory into the folder where you extracted files `cd ~/route/to/your/folder`
3. Run the program you're interested in, like `python logistic_interactive.py`
4. To make changes to the code, install a text editor like [Atom](https://atom.io) and then open the file you want to edit. If this is your first python project, GO FOT IT, but also it might not be the easiest to get your head wrapped around (I use a lot of nuanced python functionality).

#### If you run into problems
0. Google the problem you're running into
1. If it seems to be a problem with **this** code, post in "Issues"
